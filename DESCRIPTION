Description: This package provides a vignette describing how to use
	     Bioconductor with the help on Containers. It provides an
	     overview for both beginners and advanced users. Using
	     Bioconductor on containers takes away the pain of having
	     to manage and install system dependencies. The user needs
	     to only have a working version of a Container technology
	     such as Docker.
