## Who is this for?

This workshop is for a beginner. You don't have to have any prior
experience with Docker or container technology. In this course
participants are expected to launch Docker images on their local
machines, mount volumes, and set ports as needed for RStudio

Since it's a beginners course, please note that we will be starting at
a basic level.

## Why Docker

Docker is the most popular container technology being used today. But
what is a container?

Container is a completely isolate environment. They can have their own
processes or services or network interfaces, volume mounts, just like
a virtual machine. They differ from VM's only in a single aspect, they
"share" the OS kernel.
