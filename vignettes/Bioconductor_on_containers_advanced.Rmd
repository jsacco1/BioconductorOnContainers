## Containers on the cloud

It is easy to launch Docker on the cloud as well.

There are a couple of ways this can be done, one is using the a
service on different cloud provides called "Container Engines", the
other by natively installing `docker` as a service on compute
instance.

[Install Docker on Gcloud Ubuntu VM](https://github.com/nturaga/gcloud_docker_install/blob/master/docker_install.sh)
with the help of this script. 

Once Docker is installed it's easy to run a container just like you would on a local machine.
